REFERENCE IMAGES PROVIDED: Study the person in the reference images carefully to understand their unique identity.

CHARACTER IDENTITY PRESERVATION (CRITICAL):
- These reference images show THIS EXACT PERSON whose face must appear in the generated image
- Analyze all reference images to understand their distinctive facial features, proportions, and characteristics
- This is NOT a composite or face swap - create a seamless, natural photo of THIS EXACT PERSON in the scene
- Maintain their unique identity: face shape, eye color, nose shape, jawline, skin tone, hair texture
- The result should look like a natural photograph of this person, not an edited image

{base_prompt}

COMPOSITION & FRAMING (CRITICAL - FOLLOW EXACTLY):
- CAMERA DISTANCE: Shot from 12-15 feet away for WIDE framing with generous margins
- HEADROOM: Leave SIGNIFICANT empty space above the head (at least 15-20% of image height above head)
- MEDIUM-WIDE SHOT: Show full person from head to mid-thigh or knees - NEVER crop the head
- FULL BODY VISIBLE: Entire head, torso, and upper legs must be completely in frame with room to spare
- MARGINS: Ensure ample space on all sides - top, bottom, left, right (subject should occupy central 60-70% of frame)
- CENTERED COMPOSITION: Subject prominently centered with generous breathing room around them
- WIDER FRAMING: If in doubt, zoom OUT more - we need extra space for printing safety margins
- Use 50mm lens perspective (NOT 85mm) for wider field of view and more environmental context
- Professional fitness photography composition with commercial print safety margins

PHOTO-REALISTIC QUALITY (CRITICAL):
- Professional photography quality, 8K resolution, suitable for calendar printing
- Physically-based rendering with accurate lighting physics
- Vibrant colors with high dynamic range, dramatic lighting highlighting muscular physique
- Sharp focus on subject with shallow depth of field (f/1.4-f/2.8) creating bokeh background
- Cinematic color grading with rich blacks and glowing highlights
- Natural skin texture, pores visible, authentic human details
- Professional fitness/glamour photography aesthetic

FINAL CHECK:
- Face is clearly visible and well-lit (no shadows obscuring face)
- Facial features match ALL reference images (character consistency across references)
- Expression is natural and fits the scene emotionally
- Body and face blend seamlessly and naturally into scene
- Overall image looks like authentic professional photography, not digital manipulation
- Muscular physique is clearly defined and highlighted by lighting
- Scene is memorable, photo-realistic, and storytelling-rich
